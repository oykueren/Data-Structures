# Maximum Fish Catch in an Archipelago

## Project Overview

In this project, we tackle the challenge of a fisherman navigating a group of islands within an archipelago. The fisherman's journey involves traveling only on one-way safe routes connecting these islands, where each island has exactly two out-routes. The primary objective is to devise a code that can calculate and determine the maximum number of fish that the fisherman can catch during his exploration of the archipelago.
